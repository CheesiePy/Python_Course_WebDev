## varibles in python are lower case and we are using snake_case to declare multiple words varibles 

Name = "may" # we Use UpperCase when we want to declair a global concidered a bad practice

first_name = ""

last_name = ""

age = 29

height = 1.80

# to find out the data type use the function type()

# to get output out off our sript we will use the print() function 

# [example] make python print your full name:

print(first_name, last_name)

# [example] make python print the type of a varible

print(type(height), type(age)) # run to see results


# [Q1] :
    # create a var that represent the number of siblings you have
sib_number = 2

# [Q2] :
    # print the type of the var you created in Q1
print(type(sib_number), end=" ")

# [Q3] :
    # print your age in 10 years from now by using the age var
print(age + 10)   

# [Q4] :
    # print your age 10 years ago by using the age var
